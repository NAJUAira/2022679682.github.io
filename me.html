<p style=font-family:serif;font-size:30px>This is my life in university right now. I feel very thankful to be part from uitm students. Going to college is my childhood dream because I was excited thinking about, I can bring phone to class and wearing casual every day. But somehow, sometimes I get confused to think what I gonna wear to class because I dont want people to notice me wearing same clothes every day. However, I must admit that my family and friends is my backbone because they always give me strength and motivation to keep reminds me to follow my dream which is to be lecturer one days. Despite there are so many challenges, I want give the best of my effort to achieve my dream. Eventhough, I might fail or lose hope but at least I will feel satisfied on my own hard work.
