My family are very simple we are not rich but we always full of love and laughter. My mother has a rather firm personality in educating her child because my father always works long distance from home. So, mother need to take responsibilities of being mother and father at the same time while my father was busy working for us. However, I know my mother is loving all her child and will ensure her child will achieve they dream because my mother always saids "My dream do'not come true because my family poor but my childs need to be more successful than me." Then, my father is very calm person he always buy anythings for us even sometimes I know he doesn't have enough money for himself. He love to saw our siblings gather and spend times together, he always laugh to my siblings funny behavior. Lastly, I very proud to be daughter of Mazalan Bin Jantan and Siti Zubaidah Bt Hj. Abdullah and I promise to myself to make them proud and smile till the end. This is because they are my world I can loss anything but surely not them.</p>
