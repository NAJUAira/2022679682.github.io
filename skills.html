Alhamdulilah, thanks to my lecturer that give undivided attention and infinite help for me to understands the subjects. I had memorable moments in learning together with my lecturer and friends. they always give support by helping each other. We always exchange opinion and idea  to generate new ideas or solve all doubts. I truly appreciate this relationship because they always help classmates to ensure nobody left behind in the learning sessions. Also, I was able to learn a lot of things about how to hadle emotions and work in group. Which is, I can improved my soft skills to interact well in social.
